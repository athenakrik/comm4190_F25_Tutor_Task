    "Session 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "The first session felt like an informative and free-flowing conversation with a very knowledgeable assistant rather than an actual tutor. The tone was confident and professional, but not necessarily student-centered. It delivered long, detailed explanations quickly without checking for understanding or helping me build knowledge step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first half, the tutor gave solid information about VC models (asset vs. platform), value inflection points, and milestone-based funding, but I noticed I didn’t have to do much thinking — I mostly listened and asked surface questions. When I started to act distracted, the tutor tried to redirect me but did so in a slightly mechanical way (“Want a 60 second challenge?” or “Here is a plan you can fill in”). It stayed on topic but lacked emotional warmth or adaptive pacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Session 1 was informative but passive. I learned facts, not frameworks. It felt more like a lecture or consulting chat than a tutoring session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Session 2 \n",
    "\n",
    "The second session felt much more like a real tutorial. The tutor began by introducing itself, asking what I wanted to learn, my level, and what I already knew — which immediately made me feel like an active participant. That simple structure (“What do you already know?” → “What do you want to learn specifically?”) set expectations clearly and personalized the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the conversation, the tutor used questions to guide me, not just statements. For example, instead of explaining why platforms attract VC funding, it asked, “What do you think might make investors prefer a platform over a single-asset biotech?” That Socratic approach made me reason through answers and feel ownership of my understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I got distracted (“Do you like dogs?”), the tutor responded empathetically but skillfully redirected the topic — even looping the distraction back to the theme (“Dogs actually inspired structure-based models”). The tone was upbeat, patient, and confidence-building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Session 2 felt interactive, motivational, and cognitively engaging. It encouraged critical thinking, reflection, and synthesis rather than just absorption of facts."
